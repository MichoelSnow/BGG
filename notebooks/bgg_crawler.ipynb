       "<description>Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &amp;ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&amp;rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&amp;rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Normally, I'll dock part of a point because of issues like that, but this might be my favorite game of all time.  I'm not docking points for needing to use a Plano box, when this game has occupied all of my thoughts.  It's excellent.\"/>\n",

This is like a dream come true, I couldn't have asked for better. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!  #1 BEST Dungeon crawl #1 BEST Legacy game #1 BEST Cooperative game  Also one of my SO's favorite games.  Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can't wait to play some more. I haven't played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it's a bit too long (I've played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I'd need to try it again just to be sure.  Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we &quot;finished&quot; the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I'm pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting. Waiting for an expansion!\"/>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"bwt2q\" value=\"Gloomhaven is, at the time I wrote this, the #1 ranked game on BGG.  I think the consistently high ratings are well deserved.  I have really enjoyed the 7.5 games I've played so far (we're mid-mission right now!).  Gloomhaven is, first and foremost, a kind of optimization puzzle that you solve with 1-3 of your friends.  It has received much criticism because the puzzle is mostly the same, which I think misses the point.  This an excellent puzzle, with a large number of truly meaningful decisions, and scenarios that have very finely honed difficulty.  It's like a book of Crosswords or Sodoku - if you don't like the puzzle, a whole book will seem boring.  But if you like the puzzle, then it's great.  I find the puzzle of Gloomhaven to be absolutely enthralling, and the scenarios do a great job, IMO, of mixing it up enough that I don't feel like I'm just rinse and repeating my way through the game.  YMMV.  If you're thinking about buying it, you should know that you can play the first scenario for FREE with any of the first 6 classes on Tabletopia.  See if you like the puzzle before sinking $100 into it.  Aside from the main game, Gloomhaven's scenarios and campaign are really a labor of love, and it shows throughout.  There are way more enemies here than there really need to be, but it sure is nice to not fight the same 6 enemies all the time.  The standees work well, and keep the game affordable, so I appreciate them even if I still want minis.  Likewise for the character classes - 17 is more variety than most people will ever see, but it's there for those who want to explore.  I love that you are supposed to play the game to unlock the classes.  Each individual class has an individual set of higher level cards that become accessible as they level up, plus individualized perks that make their modifier deck better.  The modifier deck is brilliant, by the way, and the way you can improve it is simple yet fantastic - one of the many &quot;little&quot; touches that makes Gloomhaven such an amazing creation.  Lastly, I want to mention that I am currently playing Gloomhaven with my kids, who are 11, 9, and 7.  My youngest definitely needs a lot of help figuring out what she wants to do.  I give the 9yo some advice each turn about general group strategy and he plays competently, although not always optimally.  My 11yo plays with zero advice (he wouldn't listen anyway), and plays very well.  It's been a great experience.\"/>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"pixel pusher\" value=\"Incredible game. Certainly not perfect and I had hoped for more outside of the combat, but what is there is very entertaining. Haven't tired of it yet.   The primary focus of the game is the card play for your actions and the optimization puzzle that presents. Things are dynamic enough that situation never plays out the same and you have a multitude of solutions to getting through things. It takes about 3+ play throughs to see all content. The reality is that your game is going to go differently than someone elses.  The game gives off a rpg video game vibe with branching story decision paths as well as which missions you choose to complete and when influencing how things play out. Fire Emblem/final fantasy tactics the board game? Less Baulders gate and more tactical strategy Jrpg mixed with some Mage Knight &quot;lite&quot;. That may sound like the best thing ever to you or the worst.   Some may prefer games like Shadows of Brimstone over this game. Certainly do your research before buying this. This is definitely a euro game design style. No dice chucking.  Looking forward to what else this designer comes up with.  The version I got was $60 from the first kickstarter. A friend of mine wants it now but he has to pay $140. Ouch. It's a great game and if I had to do it again I'd pay the $140 but no more than that.  I rate the game a 9 because the legacy aspect makes a score of 10 impossible if strictly going by BGG's ranking descriptions. However I would unofficially declare it a 10 while you are playing it.  edit: I should also note that I find this game very compelling. Probably the most compelling board game I own. I want to play this every chance I get. I want to play it like I do my most favorite computer games. I have  board games I like a lot, but nothing this compelling to date. This game is really a 10 on my list. It is one of my top 10. Certainly one of my top 5.  edit: I have since found ways to make the game non-permanent. Removable stickers and resources have made it possible for us to replay this numerous times now. So I have bumped my rating up to a 10. Seriously one of the very best games I've played and owned to date.\"/>\n",

The base of the game is it's tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren't destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn't have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It's worth every penny.  You can read my review [geekurl=/thread/1720130/welcome-gloomhaven-initial-impressions-now-50-less]here[/geekurl] if you're interested.

       "<description>Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &amp;ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&amp;rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&amp;rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

This is like a dream come true, I couldn't have asked for better. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!  #1 BEST Dungeon crawl #1 BEST Legacy game #1 BEST Cooperative game  Also one of my SO's favorite games.  Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can't wait to play some more. I haven't played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it's a bit too long (I've played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I'd need to try it again just to be sure.  Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we &quot;finished&quot; the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I'm pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting. Waiting for an expansion!\"/>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"bwt2q\" value=\"Gloomhaven is, at the time I wrote this, the #1 ranked game on BGG.  I think the consistently high ratings are well deserved.  I have really enjoyed the 7.5 games I've played so far (we're mid-mission right now!).  Gloomhaven is, first and foremost, a kind of optimization puzzle that you solve with 1-3 of your friends.  It has received much criticism because the puzzle is mostly the same, which I think misses the point.  This an excellent puzzle, with a large number of truly meaningful decisions, and scenarios that have very finely honed difficulty.  It's like a book of Crosswords or Sodoku - if you don't like the puzzle, a whole book will seem boring.  But if you like the puzzle, then it's great.  I find the puzzle of Gloomhaven to be absolutely enthralling, and the scenarios do a great job, IMO, of mixing it up enough that I don't feel like I'm just rinse and repeating my way through the game.  YMMV.  If you're thinking about buying it, you should know that you can play the first scenario for FREE with any of the first 6 classes on Tabletopia.  See if you like the puzzle before sinking $100 into it.  Aside from the main game, Gloomhaven's scenarios and campaign are really a labor of love, and it shows throughout.  There are way more enemies here than there really need to be, but it sure is nice to not fight the same 6 enemies all the time.  The standees work well, and keep the game affordable, so I appreciate them even if I still want minis.  Likewise for the character classes - 17 is more variety than most people will ever see, but it's there for those who want to explore.  I love that you are supposed to play the game to unlock the classes.  Each individual class has an individual set of higher level cards that become accessible as they level up, plus individualized perks that make their modifier deck better.  The modifier deck is brilliant, by the way, and the way you can improve it is simple yet fantastic - one of the many &quot;little&quot; touches that makes Gloomhaven such an amazing creation.  Lastly, I want to mention that I am currently playing Gloomhaven with my kids, who are 11, 9, and 7.  My youngest definitely needs a lot of help figuring out what she wants to do.  I give the 9yo some advice each turn about general group strategy and he plays competently, although not always optimally.  My 11yo plays with zero advice (he wouldn't listen anyway), and plays very well.  It's been a great experience.\"/>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"pixel pusher\" value=\"Incredible game. Certainly not perfect and I had hoped for more outside of the combat, but what is there is very entertaining. Haven't tired of it yet.   The primary focus of the game is the card play for your actions and the optimization puzzle that presents. Things are dynamic enough that situation never plays out the same and you have a multitude of solutions to getting through things. It takes about 3+ play throughs to see all content. The reality is that your game is going to go differently than someone elses.  The game gives off a rpg video game vibe with branching story decision paths as well as which missions you choose to complete and when influencing how things play out. Fire Emblem/final fantasy tactics the board game? Less Baulders gate and more tactical strategy Jrpg mixed with some Mage Knight &quot;lite&quot;. That may sound like the best thing ever to you or the worst.   Some may prefer games like Shadows of Brimstone over this game. Certainly do your research before buying this. This is definitely a euro game design style. No dice chucking.  Looking forward to what else this designer comes up with.  The version I got was $60 from the first kickstarter. A friend of mine wants it now but he has to pay $140. Ouch. It's a great game and if I had to do it again I'd pay the $140 but no more than that.  I rate the game a 9 because the legacy aspect makes a score of 10 impossible if strictly going by BGG's ranking descriptions. However I would unofficially declare it a 10 while you are playing it.  edit: I should also note that I find this game very compelling. Probably the most compelling board game I own. I want to play this every chance I get. I want to play it like I do my most favorite computer games. I have  board games I like a lot, but nothing this compelling to date. This game is really a 10 on my list. It is one of my top 10. Certainly one of my top 5.  edit: I have since found ways to make the game non-permanent. Removable stickers and resources have made it possible for us to replay this numerous times now. So I have bumped my rating up to a 10. Seriously one of the very best games I've played and owned to date.\"/>\n",

The base of the game is it's tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren't destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn't have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It's worth every penny.  You can read my review [geekurl=/thread/1720130/welcome-gloomhaven-initial-impressions-now-50-less]here[/geekurl] if you're interested.
